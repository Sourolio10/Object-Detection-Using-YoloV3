# Object-Detection-Using-YoloV3
In recent years, deep learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results for object detection, such as on standard benchmark datasets and in computer vision competitions. Notable is the “You Only Look Once,” or YOLO, family of Convolutional Neural Networks that achieve near state-of-the-art results with a single end-to-end model that can perform object detection in real-time. The approach involves a single deep convolutional neural network (originally a version of GoogLeNet, later updated and called DarkNet based on VGG) that splits the input into a grid of cells and each cell directly predicts a bounding box and object classification. The result is a large number of candidate bounding boxes that are consolidated into a final prediction by a post-processing step.  There are three main variations of the approach, at the time of writing; they are YOLOv1, YOLOv2, and YOLOv3. The first version proposed the general architecture, whereas the second version refined the design and made use of predefined anchor boxes to improve bounding box proposal, and version three further refined the model architecture and training process.
